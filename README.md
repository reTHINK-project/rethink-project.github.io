The reTHINK Framework is a decentralised communication infrastructure (licensed with Apache 2.0) that enables developers to easily build and integrate, communication services that are faster, more effective , more trustful and inherently inter-operable. Write once, deploy anywhere, together with seamless cross domain Interoperability, gives developers and service providers much more freedom to really focus on users' expectations.

Ultimately, reTHINK framework is an alternative to current dominant walled garden communication networks that prevent new developers and new service providers from entering in the market and, at the same time, empowers the users with the choice and the management of their private data and identities.

The reTHINK Framework provides the tools to build a global decentralised network of [Hyperlinked Entities (hyperties)](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs/blob/master/tutorials/hyperty.md) that are executed at the edge and trustfully communicates through a [Decentralised Messaging Framework](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs/blob/master/messaging-framework/readme.md).
