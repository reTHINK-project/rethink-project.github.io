The [reTHINK Framework Specifications](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs) are composed of:

* the [service framework specification](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs/blob/master/service-framework/readme.md) that provides some libraries to facilitate the development of Hyperties compliant with the specs.

* the [Decentralised Messaging Framework specification](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs/blob/master/messaging-framework/readme.md) that is used to support hyperty communication across domains dramatically reducing standardisation efforts thanks to the protocol-on-the-fly concept and to the P2P Reporter-Observer pattern. More detailed specs are provided to:
  * [Protostubs used by the protocol-on-the-fly mechanism](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs/blob/master/messaging-framework/stub-specification.md)
  * [Messaging Nodes providing the brokering of messages](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs/blob/master/messaging-framework/msg-node.md)
  * [P2P Data Synchronisation](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs/blob/master/messaging-framework/p2p-data-sync.md)


* the [runtime specification](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs/blob/master/runtime/readme.md) that is used to support Hyperties execution in multiple platforms including browsers, NodeJS and Smartphones.

* the [trust and identity management specification](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs/tree/master/trust-management) that supports fully secured and trustful communication among Hyperties by using independent Identity Providers, giving the user full control of his Identity and personal data. More detailed specs are provided to:
  * [Mutual Authentication](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs/blob/master/trust-management/mutual-authentication.md)
  * [peer to peer data communication encryption](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs/blob/master/trust-management/secure-communication.md)

* the specification on how to [interoperate with legacy services](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs/tree/master/legacy-interworking) that are not compliant with reTHINK framework


* [Communication Control Main Workflows](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs/blob/master/tutorials/comm-setup.md)

* [Procedures to Manage Hyperty Data Objects]()
