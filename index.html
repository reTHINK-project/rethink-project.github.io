          <p>Decentralized Trust with new or existing Identity Providers.</p>
          <p>The reTHINK Framework empowers the users with the choice and the management of their private data and identities.</p>
          <p>With Decentralized Communications, services are securely associated to User Identities that are managed by independent Identity Providers. The end-user is empowered to decide about which Identity Provider to trust, i.e. User Identities are decoupled from Service Providers. Users are human beings (including group of human beings e.g. corporation) or things (including group of things and physical spaces, e.g. a smart home or smart building). The Decentralized Communication Trust Model extends the WebRTC Identity model where Identity tokens are generated, inserted in intercepted Messages sent by Services, and validated before being delivered to the target Service.</p>
