            <h2>Adhoc Interoperability with Quasi Zero Standards</h2>
            <p>The reTHINK framework introduces a new communication paradigm called Decentralized Communications which enables cross-domain communication services to trustfully use peer-to-peer networks</p>
          </div>
          <p>Thanks to radical new concepts like Protocol on-the-fly and Reporter-Observer peer-to-peer data synchronization pattern, Decentralized Applications developed by different teams and deployed in different domains, can easily interoperate, without having to agree in advance on common protocols or service APIs</p>

        <h2>Power back to People</h2>
        <p>Decentralized Trust with new or existing Identity Providers.</p>
        <p>The reTHINK Framework empowers the users with the choice and the management of their private data and identities.</p>
        <p>With Decentralized Communications, services are securely associated to User Identities that are managed by independent Identity Providers. The end-user is empowered to decide about which Identity Provider to trust, i.e. User Identities are decoupled from Service Providers. Users are human beings (including group of human beings e.g. corporation) or things (including group of things and physical spaces, e.g. a smart home or smart building). The Decentralized Communication Trust Model extends the WebRTC Identity model where Identity tokens are generated, inserted in intercepted Messages sent by Services, and validated before being delivered to the target Service.</p>
