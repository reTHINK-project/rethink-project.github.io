## reTHINK Main Concepts

The reTHINK framework introduces a new communication paradigm called **Decentralized Communications** which enables cross-domain communication services to trustfully use peer-to-peer networks.
Decentralized Communication services are inherently inter-operable without the need to standardize protocols or service APIs.
Decentralized Communications can be applied to any kind of communication, including human-to-human, human-to-things, and things-to-things communication. More information [here](concepts/readme.md).

**Protocol on-the-fly (Protofly)** - provides transport interoperability without requiring the standardization of messaging protocols.
Protocol on-the-fly leverages the code on-demand support by Web runtimes (eg Javascript), to dynamically select, load and instantiate the most appropriate protocol stack during run-time. Such characteristic enables protocols to be selected at run-time and not at design time, enabling protocol interoperability among distributed services, promoting loosely coupled service architectures, optimising resources spent by avoiding the need to have Protocol Gateways in service's middleware as well as minimising standardisation efforts. More information [here](concepts/protofly.md).

**Protostub** - The implementation of the protocol stack, e.g. in a javascript file, that is dynamically loaded from the Service Provider and instantiated at run-time by using the Protocol on-the-fly concept.

**Decentralized Messaging Framework** - is based on a distributed network of routers where each router only knows adjacent registered routers or end-points.
It is designed on top of a Resource Oriented Messaging model that supports publish/subscribe as well as request/response messaging patterns.
Messages are used to perform CRUD operations on resources handled by communication endpoints. In addition, Subscribe operations on resources are also supported in order to be notified on any change performed to such resource.
The Protocol on-the-fly is used by the Decentralized Messaging Framework to be protocol agnostic, i.e. devices and domains using different messaging protocols (e.g. SIP, Matrix) can exchange messages with each other. More information [here](concepts/decentralized-messaging.md).

**Reporter - Observer peer-to-peer Data Synchronisation** - While the Protocol on-the-fly provides transport interoperability without requiring the standardization of messaging protocols, the Reporter - Observer communication pattern enables semantic interoperability between Services without having to standardize Service APIs.
It extends existing Observable communication patterns by using a P2P data stream synchronization solution for programmatic Objects e.g. JSON Objects, simply called Data Objects.
The Reporter is the only peer with permissions to write to the Data Object while all the other service instances only have permissions to read the Data Object - the Observers.
As soon as the Reporter performs changes to Data Objects, they are immediately propagated to any authorized Observer. More information [here](concepts/reporter-observer.md)

**Hyperties** - Hyperties is a new service paradigm built on top of reTHINK decentralized communication framework that follows microservices architectural patterns. This means Hyperties are independently deployable components each one providing a small set of business capabilities, using the smart endpoints and dumb pipes philosophy. More information [here](concepts/hyperty.md).

While there is no precise definition of this architectural style, there are certain common characteristics around organization around business capability, automated deployment, intelligence in the endpoints, and decentralized control of languages and data.
